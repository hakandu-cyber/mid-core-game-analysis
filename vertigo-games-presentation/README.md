## Key Sections in the Presentation

### FTUE & Tutorial
- Current gaps: only basic onboarding, weak cinematic support.  
- Suggested improvements: stronger tutorial guidance, cinematic intro, crouch/jump coverage.  

### UI Impression
- Current: Complex main menu, overlapping options, limited customization.  
- Suggestions: Button customization, simplified navigation, grouped reward sections.  

### Visual Effects & Animations
- Current: Large static weapon model, weak crouch/jump feedback.  
- Suggestions: Weapon sway, reduced size, sliding crouch animation for immersion.  

### Core Loop
- Structure: Play match â†’ Earn XP & currency â†’ Unlock skins.  
- Issues: Rewards time-based, daily challenges shallow, ranked mode not competitive enough.  
- Suggestions: Match-based rewards, stronger ranked system, seasonal progression.  

### Economy
- Current: Strong push to purchase, aggressive special offers.  
- Suggestions: Balanced monetization, beginner-friendly offers, event-driven Piggy Bank.  

### Churn Analysis
- **D1:** Weak onboarding, chaotic menu, excessive auto-aim.  
- **D7:** Time-based rewards dominate, lack of daily motivation, no limited-time content.  
- **D30:** No endgame progression, monetization walls free users.  

### A/B Testing Suggestions
1. **Time-Based vs Match Count Rewards** â†’ Match completion, Conversion, D7 Retention.  
2. **Simplified vs Default Menu Layout** â†’ Retention D1, Navigation efficiency.  
3. **Dynamic vs Static Weapon Feedback** â†’ Player feedback, Session length, D7/D30 Retention.  

### Piggy Bank (Event-Based)
- Limited-time (seasonal events).  
- Always rewarding (exclusive skins + gold/keys).  
- Creates urgency and FOMO, tied directly to gameplay.
