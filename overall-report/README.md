## Conclusion
The report highlights that **Critical Strike** has strong short-term appeal but suffers from limited onboarding depth, weak progression systems, and aggressive monetization.  
With targeted improvements in **tutorial design, UI clarity, competitive incentives, and event-driven monetization**, the game can achieve stronger retention and long-term growth.
