## A/B Testing Suggestions

### 1. Time-Based Rewards vs Match Count-Based Rewards

**Test:**  

- Group A: Existing system (rewards at 5m, 20m, 40m, 60m, 120m, 180m).
  
- Group B: New system (rewards at 3, 5, 10, 15 matches completed).  

**Reason:**  

Time-based rewards encourage passive play (idling), while match-based rewards require active participation and foster competition. Active engagement increases likelihood of interest in in-game offers with competitive advantage.  

**Target KPIs:**  

- Match Completion Rate
  
- Conversion Rate (Paying User Ratio)
  
- Session Length
  
- Retention D7

### 2. Simplified vs Default Main Menu Layout

**Test:**  

- Group A: Current cluttered menu (many icons, small text, multiple pop-ups).
  
- Group B: Simplified menu with grouped reward sections, larger labels, fewer elements.
   

**Reason:**  

The current main menu overwhelms new players with too much text and overlapping elements. Grouping key sections (Missions, Battle Pass, Daily Rewards, Inventory) and consolidating rewards improves clarity and helps players focus on meaningful goals.  

**Target KPIs:**  

- Retention D1
  
- UI Interaction Rate
  
- Menu Navigation Time
  
- Menu Exit Rate

### 3. Dynamic Weapon Feedback vs Static Weapon Display

**Test:** 

- Group A: Static weapon during running, large on-screen model, no movement feedback.
  
- Group B: Animated weapon sway while sprinting, sliding crouch animation, reduced weapon size.
   

**Reason:** 

Improved weapon animations enhance immersion. Static display reduces connection with gameplay. Adding sway/slide effects and reducing weapon size improves feedback, visibility, and player comfort.  

**Target KPIs:**  

- Match Completion Rate
  
- Session Length
  
- Player Feedback Score (qualitative)
  
- Retention D7 & D30
