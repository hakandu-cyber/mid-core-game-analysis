## A/B Testing Suggestions

### 1. Time-Based Rewards vs Match Count-Based Rewards

**Test:**  

- Group A: Existing system (rewards at 5m, 20m, 40m, 60m, 120m, 180m).
  
- Group B: New system (rewards at 3, 5, 10, 15 matches completed).  

**Reason:**  

Time-based reward systems may encourage players to stay in the game passively with low interaction. A player might leave the game open without seriously playing, just to collect rewards. In contrast, a match-based reward system keeps the player actively involved and creates a more competitive environment. As a result, the player may show more interest in in-game offers that provide a competitive advantage.


**Target KPIs:**  

- Match Completion Rate
  
- Conversion Rate (Paying User Ratio)
  
- Session Length
  
- Retention D7

### 2. Simplified vs Default Main Menu Layout

**Test:**  

- Group A: Current cluttered menu (many icons, small text, multiple pop-ups).
  
- Group B: Simplified menu with grouped reward sections, larger labels, fewer elements.
   

**Reason:**  

The active main menu includes too much text, constant pop-ups, and overlapping elements, creating a chaotic user experience. This confusion can cause players to feel lost and disconnected, especially on their first day. Key sections such as Missions, Battle Pass, Daily Rewards, and Inventory can be grouped into clear categories to reduce clutter. Crates and time- based rewards can also be gathered into a single, well-defined section to improve clarity and help players focus on meaningful goals.

**Target KPIs:**  

- Retention D1
  
- UI Interaction Rate
  
- Menu Navigation Time
  
- Menu Exit Rate

### 3. Dynamic Weapon Feedback vs Static Weapon Display

**Test:** 

- Group A: Static weapon during running, large on-screen model, no movement feedback.
  
- Group B: Animated weapon sway while sprinting, sliding crouch animation, reduced weapon size.
   

**Reason:** 

Improving movement and weapon animations can significantly enhance the feel of gameplay. A static weapon model makes the game feel less immersive. Adding visual details like weapon sway or a small slide effect when crouching while sprinting helps the player feel more connected to the characterâ€™s motion. Reducing weapon size also improves visibility and comfort during matches.

**Target KPIs:**  

- Match Completion Rate
  
- Session Length
  
- Player Feedback Score (qualitative)
  
- Retention D7 & D30
