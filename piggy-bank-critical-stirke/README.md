## Piggy Bank Feature – Event-Based Implementation

### 4.1 Concept

Piggy Bank should not be a permanent feature, but a **limited-time system** activated only during seasonal events (e.g., New Year, Halloween). This limited availability creates urgency and builds community engagement by aligning with event themes and visuals.

### 4.2 How The System Works

• Available only during a 7–14 day event period.  

• Players earn coins by completing matches, kills, or wins.  

• Coins accumulate in the Piggy Bank. Once full, players receive a prompt to unlock it for a fixed price (e.g., ₺89.99).  

• The Piggy Bank visibly fills after each match, creating anticipation and progression.  


### 4.3 Rewards & Content

• Every unlock guarantees one **event-exclusive skin**.  

• Rarity tiers: Common / Rare / Epic / Legendary (chance-based).  

• Additional rewards: gold or crate keys.  

• Skins are **only available during that event**, increasing exclusivity and perceived value.  


### 4.4 Psychological Impact

• Always rewarding — no “empty” unlock.  

• Skin rarity motivates repeated engagement.  

• Time-limited exclusivity builds urgency and stronger emotional connection.  

• No forced monetization — directly tied to active gameplay.
